# Devish
A simple language for developers to use in communication.

WELL, how does it look like? Devish is mostly based off other existing languages,
like how many English words were from Latin language - a partially extinct
language.

Why does this exist anyways? Well, 25% of all languages are being used on
GitHub, and English is the most used, with the language of... *MANDARIN*
CHINESE... just behind (many GitHub users like `@ventoy` are from China)??

## Learning
Devish should be easy for some English speakers and speakers of many other
Latin script languages.

If you very rarely speak in Latin script languages (or similar scripts like
Greek script) and most often use machine translators to write in English,
check out the [wiki](https://github.com/TylerMS887/devish/wiki) for
help on speaking Devish.

See `devish.txt` for the file about the whole language.
